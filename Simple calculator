# Calculator Applications
This repository contains two calculator applications: a console-based calculator and a GUI-based calculator.
## Console Calculator
The console calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) through the command line.
### How to Use
1. **Compile the `ConsoleCalculator` class:**
   ```sh
   javac ConsoleCalculator.java
   ```
2. **Run the `ConsoleCalculator` class**:

   ```
3. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Enter the first number.
   - Enter the operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
   - Enter the second number.
   - The result will be displayed.
   - You will be asked if you want to continue. Enter `y` to continue or `n` to exit.
**Example**
```
	Enter first number:
	5
	Enter operator (+, -, *, /):
	+
	Enter second number:
	3
	Result: 8.0
	Continue? (y/n):
	n
```
## GUI Calculator
The GUI calculator provides a graphical user interface for performing basic arithmetic operations.
**How to Use**
1. **Compile the `calculator` class:**
```
	javac Calculator.java
```
2. **Run the calculator class:**
```
	java calculator
```
3. **Use the GUI:**
   - Click the number buttons to enter the first number.
   - Click the operator buttons(`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to select the operation.
